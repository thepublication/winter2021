<h2>essay</h2>
<p> style="color:#FF007F;" This list probably doesn’t need essays anymore, and defining and categorizing the flow around us doesn’t feel so necessary. But to explain some details, and problems, we’ll offer this anyhow. First, we need to acknowledge a key Out item: this list and others like it. Such epistemologies (lol) remain relevant in that currents both in and out are still always happening. 2021 in itself has a digital binary (the original in/out?). However, too many currents happen at once for any list to ever be accurate. While that’s always been true of these lists and recognized by the authors, it feels more important to say now as the list feels more and more futile.

That being said, we move onto the current list in detail. This year it has been harder than ever to figure out the overall direction or sensibility of the list, despite everyone being under the same umbrella of experience. The only overarching element is, perhaps, breathability. In a literal sense: feet and open toed shoes (to the dismay of extremely sweaty feet havers, like myself). But also in a general breathability, an in-out, so to speak. We don’t believe this needs much explanation. 

To end, I just have to say it has been difficult to bring myself to do or create anything which is why this list took so long (not than anyone cares). </p>
